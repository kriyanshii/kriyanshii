<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Kriyanshi</h1>
<h3>backend developer and a software tinkerer</h3>

I work somewhere between satellites, distributed systems, and the people who need their data on time.  
Most days, I’m designing workflows, orchestrating compute, and shaping quiet infrastructure behind the scenes.

### Work I gravitate toward
- Systems that schedule themselves  
- Pipelines that don’t blink  
- Interactive environments that make complex research feel simple  

### Things I build when no one’s looking
- Small shells  
- MapReduce experiments  
- Queues, DAGs, odd abstractions that solve oddly specific problems  

### Outside the machine
- I play the flute  
- I learn the names of trees  
- I read—slowly, and often

### Elsewhere
